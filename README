This plugin is used for Java code completion. It's depends on ctags , 
vim which +ruby future is enabled.
For generate tags :
         ctags --fileds=+ai   .....
For  generate tags Index file:
         :ruby generateIndex("/usr/java/jdk/src/tags",2)
The second parameter which value is 2  is recommand.

Once you vim version is 7.00aa 
         :set cfu=OocompleteFun
You can use <CTRL>-x<CTRL>-u for this samle:
        String str="";
        str.to
                ^<CTRL>-X<CTRL>-U
For c++ user:
         SomeClass * abc;
         abc->So
                        ^<CTRL>-X<CTRL>-U
Both java and c++
         Abc::So
                        ^<CTRL>-X<CTRL>-U
Then toByteArray, toUpperCase...  would be selectable.

vim version is 6.xx
         :Oofun String to
First parameter is name of the class , the second is the function name ( partly)
Then toByteArray, toUpperCase...  would be show in command window.

One command is added, It's used to check variable type
         :Ootype varname

TODO list :
         ctags's support for jdk1.5 , something incorrectly. like ,java.util.Vector
         Advanced varible define selector. Something lik normal command gd

         The last, my poor document  and my poor English,
